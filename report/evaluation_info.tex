Copied from the lab assignment text:\\

\noindent
A lab report describing what has been done in this project work should be handed in after the project work is completed.  For each part of the exercise the report should include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Printouts of data from relevant experiments (plots).
    \item Relevant model derivations, calculations and parameter values (remember to include units and scaling).
    \item Discussion and analysis of the results.
    \item Simulink diagrams and MATLAB code.
\end{itemize}
All group members are graded based on the report.  When the report is evaluated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item documented calculations,
    \item experimental results,  
    \item analysis and discussion of the results,
    \item skills in MATLAB/Simulink, 
    \item and the quality of the written documentation of the results will be emphasized. 
\end{itemize}
The report counts for 26 \%  of the final grade in this course.

In the following pages, we have written a skeleton that you should fill in. The italic text is only for extra guidance and should be deleted.

There should not be a need to add any other (sub)sections.\\

Unless you have a very good reason not to, you should write the report in English. If you want a larger example on how to use \LaTeX, have a look at the template that was used in TTK4115 and previously in this course as well:
