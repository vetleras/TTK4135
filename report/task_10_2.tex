\section{10.2 - Optimal Control of Pitch/Travel without Feedback }

\subsection{The continuous model}
\textit{Answer 10.2.1.1}

\subsection{The discretized model}
\textit{Answer 10.2.1.2. Remember to document the calculations.}

\subsection{The open loop optimization problem}
\textit{How is it formulated?}

\subsection{The weights of the optimization problem}
\textit{Try using the values 0.1, 1 and 10 as weights q. Plot the manipulated variable and the output. Comment the results with respect to the different weights chosen.}

\subsection{The objective function}
\textit{Furthermore, discuss the objective function (15) (in the lab assignment text) in particular the term $(\lambda_i-\lambda_f )^2$. For instance, could any unwanted effects arise from steering the helicopter to $\lambda =\lambda_f$ with this objective function?}

\subsection{Experimental results}
\textit{Printouts of data from relevant experiments (plots).
Discussion and analysis of the results.
Answer 10.2.2.7 here.}

\subsection{MATLAB and Simulink}
